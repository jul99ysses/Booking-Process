The Landingpage consists of an Information-section, a nav-bar (Home, About, Book Appointment) and a Button, that directly leads to the appointment-booking-view.

Clicked, it leads to a page where various treatments can be selected.
If a treatment is chosen, the user can continue on to the next page and select a doctor, a time and a date.
After that the user is asked to fill in their personal data and submit their request.
